# INSTRUCTIONS for BOMB BRIGADE 

### Premise 

Bomb Brigade is a high-stakes reflex-based game where two to five players take on the roles of a bomb squad in a tense electronic game reminiscent of Hot Potato or Russian Roulette. 

### Setup

2-5 players, 6 Blinks for a standard game. Designate one Blink to be the ‘bomb’ piece. This piece should be surrounded by other 5 pieces, leaving a single side of the Blink empty. Double click on the center bomb piece to start the game. To know the game has started, the center piece should have a single light circling around. 

### Goal

A player wins the game by being the last survivor of the bomb brigade, or when all the other players have been eliminated. 

### Gameplay

During normal gameplay, the circular bomb piece will begin circling around the Blink. The bomb piece will be surrounded by shield pieces which serve as a defense against the bomb when it detonates. Players take turn sparking the center bomb piece by single-tapping its center. Each time a single-tap occurs, one of two events can occur: 

**1)** The bomb doesn't go off. In this case, the light indicator will briefly flash yellow before it resumes circling around the center Blink once more, only at a faster rate. 

**2)** The bomb can detonate. In this case, the light indicator will flash orange and the other lights will turn green. 

If a bomb defuses safely, the game simply proceeds to the next player’s turn. Each time a player sparks the bomb and it doesn't go off, the likelihood that it will explode the next time it is sparked will increase. 

If the bomb detonates, it deals damage to the corresponding shield piece it is next to when it explodes. This will reduce a shield’s overall health. Each shield can withstand three bomb explosions, and their healthiness is represented by their color. When a shield is completely destroyed, it will start flashing all its lights in all colors in a haphazard manner. When this happens, this shield should be removed from the center piece and no longer be part of the game. A removed piece will emit a pleasant, rainbow swirl animation. 

If a bomb detonates in an area where there is no shield, the light indicator will turn white and the center bomb piece will start flashing red and orange. Any surviving shields will start flashing red and orange as well. When this occurs, the player who detonated the bomb is eliminated. The game continues until there is only one player left. 

If the game gets into a situation where there are no shields left but still more than one player left alive, the players must continue taking turns 

In any case when a bomb detonates, simply double-click to to reset the bomb back its default speed to proceed to the next player’s turn. This will also reset the detonation chance back to normal. 

### Animations

**White indicator, all other lights flashing red/orange** -- bomb exploded next to an area without any shield. Double-click the bomb to reset it to default state

#### Shield (surrounding pieces) 

**Green** -- the shield has not taken any damage

**Yellow** -- the shield has taken 1 hit

**Orange** -- the shield has taken 2 hits

**Red** -- the shield has taken 3 hits; can only take 1 more hit before being destroyed

**Flashing all colors** -- shield has been destroyed

**Swirling rainbow** -- shield has been removed from the center piece and the game

**Three lights pulsing yellow/red** -- shield is still active in game and has detected the bomb has exploded on an area without a shield
